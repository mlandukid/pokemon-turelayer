You can use this applications in two ways:

### As an API

By making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/pokemon/<pokemon_name>, where <pokemon_name> is the Pokemon name you are getting the description for. 
You will be returned an JSON with 2 keys, "name" and "description".

Example of this:
```` 
{
  "requestedPokemon": "charizard",
  "shakespeareTranslated": "spits fire yond is hot enow to melt boulders. Known to cause forest fires unintentionally."
}
```` 

### By using the UI

Go to http://localhost:5000/ and enter the Pokemon name in the search bar and click "Search".
The name and description will populate below the search bar, unless an error has occured, then a error message will display.
